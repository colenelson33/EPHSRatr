We discuss the impact that Big Data has on our world, what happened to our privacy and what is double factor authentication among other topics.

Figuring out why algorithms work (or don't), anticipating challenges and celebrating when everything is successful make this a rewarding adventure in computing. AP CS A: Java is an ideal course before starting the calculus sequence. Increasing your logical thinking skills, revealing how algorithms function and making your thinking transparent will help you in future mathematics, science, and engineering courses.
